Designer Login: Simple username/password authentication to access the design studio.
Room Customization: Adjust room dimensions (width, height, depth) and wall color with realistic brick wall and hardwood floor textures.
Furniture Placement: Add chairs and tables, positioned on the floor with automatic x-offset to avoid overlap. Drag-and-drop furniture with optional grid snapping for precise alignment.
Interactive Visualization: Switch between 2D (top-down) and 3D (orbit controls) views. Features a floor grid in 3D for spatial context and bright lighting for vibrant visuals.
Modern UI/UX: Glassmorphism panels, gradient backgrounds, collapsible control sections, tooltips, and confirmation dialogs for an intuitive experience.
Design Management: Save designs to local storage, edit existing designs, or delete them with confirmation prompts.
Responsive Design: Optimized for various screen sizes, including laptops (e.g., 1280x720).
